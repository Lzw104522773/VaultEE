The only thing changed is a copy of Setup.tra named Setup-ee.tra (only strings with item descriptions). This file should be adopted to use EE engine item description formatting that differs from the one in the vanilla engine. Before you start the work please check the BG:EE or BG2:EE TLK files to see how the descriptions are formatted in your language.
